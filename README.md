## General Information
- Lending club case study
- Lending club is the largest online loan marketplace, where personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical reasons.
  Borrowers can easily try for a lower interest rate on loans through an online portal.
  This analysis is done by using the information about past loan applicants and finding whether they ‘defaulted’.
  We need to understand which factors would best assess those who would be risky
- The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
